The current government has failed to deliver concrete, sustainable solutions to address the crisis of inadequate water infrastructure and services in Indigenous communities.
A new approach is needed, including a comprehensive plan that addresses both immediate and long-term needs, as well as a commitment to working closely with Indigenous communities. Each community has unique challenges, circumstances, and needs, so solutions should be led by Indigenous people themselves, prioritizing their leadership and knowledge.</div>

In today’s parliament, the importance of public healthcare was highlighted as critical for ensuring equal access to healthcare and preventing a two-tiered system where the private sector targets profitable care and leaves the public system with costly care.
