      <p>Today, the parliament discussed the government&rsquo;s efforts to prioritize partnerships with indigenous communities in mineral resource development, promoting inclusive growth and sustainable practices. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to drive economic growth while ensuring that the benefits are shared equitably among all Canadians.</p>
<p>In related news, Canada&rsquo;s economy added approximately 90,000 jobs in a single month, the most robust job creation since January 2023.
