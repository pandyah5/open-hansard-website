      <p>Today the parliament talked about labor legislation, which has gained all-party support. The speaker commended the unusual occurrence of bipartisan agreement on an issue that could positively impact Canada&rsquo;s economy and society. Multiple provinces have supported the bill, aiming to promote labor harmony.</p>
<p>Other MPs spoke in favor of the bill, highlighting Canada&rsquo;s economic performance and expressing hope for continued growth and relief from high interest rates. An MP noted that the Bloc Quebecois wanted the bill to take effect immediately after royal assent, but their proposed amendments were rejected by all parties.</p>
<p>The legislation aims to address the imbalance between employers and employees during lockouts or strikes, resulting in injustices against workers. The Bloc Quebecois proposes an amendment to repeal the delay and make the bill effective immediately after royal assent. They also suggest improvements to the bill, including closing loopholes that allow for the use of replacement workers.</p>
<p>However, these proposed amendments were rejected by all parties. The Bloc Quebecois remains concerned about the bill&rsquo;s intent and hopes that it will ultimately bring about justice for workers.</p>
