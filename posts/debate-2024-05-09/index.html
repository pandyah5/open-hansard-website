    <div class="content">
      <p>The Canadian parliament has been debating several key issues, including housing affordability, energy policy, and economic management. In a recent session, MPs discussed Bill C-59, which aims to strengthen consumer protections and environmental safeguards in the competition bill.</p>
<p><strong>Housing Affordability Crisis</strong></p>
<p>One of the most pressing issues facing Canadians is the affordable rentals crisis. The Minister of Housing, Infrastructure and Communities, Sean Fraser, acknowledged that housing costs have doubled since 2018, making it difficult for many people to find a place to live. He also addressed concerns about disaster relief funds for Abbotsford, BC.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Policy</strong></p>
<p>Another key issue being debated is energy policy. A Bloc Quebecois MP criticized the government&rsquo;s clean technology tax credit, which they argued will mainly benefit oil companies rather than renewable energy. They also expressed disappointment with the government&rsquo;s abandonment of regional transportation infrastructure, leading to a decline in public transit options.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Management</strong></p>
<p>The government has been accused of not prioritizing responsible fiscal management or the best interests of Canadians. The national debt has increased significantly under the current government, from $600 billion in 2015 to over $1.2 trillion by 2024-25. Interest costs on the federal debt have doubled in the last two years and are projected to continue increasing.</p>
<p><strong>Other Key Issues</strong></p>
<p>Other key issues being debated include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The competition bill, which aims to strengthen consumer protections and environmental safeguards</li>
<li>The housing bill, which seeks to build more homes faster</li>
<li>The government&rsquo;s track record on investing in indigenous communities</li>
<li>Pharmacare and dental care for all Canadians</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the Canadian parliament is debating several critical issues that affect the daily lives of Canadians. It remains to be seen how these debates will shape policy decisions and improve the lives of Canadians.</p>
