    <div class="content">
      <p>Today the parliament talked about whether a mistake by the Liberal Party should be allowed to thwart the will of the House. MPs argued that apologies are not enough to fix the problem and restore confidence in the institution. The Speaker&rsquo;s impartiality was questioned, and some MPs expressed concern about the impact on the institution&rsquo;s credibility.</p>
<p>The debate centered around the Conservative Party&rsquo;s behavior in the House of Commons, with the NDP accusing them of being partisan and undermining institutions. The Liberal Party was also criticized for its role in the Speaker&rsquo;s controversy. Peter Julian emphasized the need for a zero-tolerance policy on partisanship in the House and criticized the Conservatives for lacking ethics, morals, and scruples.</p>
<p>The debate touched on pharmacare, with Gord Johns highlighting the Conservative Party&rsquo;s blocking of efforts to advance pharmacare. The debate became heated, with accusations of lying and attempts to interrupt speakers.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Speaker expressed doubts about the entire institution (Parliament) due to repeated infractions by a Liberal member. Jacques Gourde questioned the Speaker&rsquo;s impartiality, pointing out that past Speakers have made mistakes without facing similar scrutiny. Others argued that the Speaker has a history of getting involved in scandals and has failed to demonstrate integrity in his role.</p>
<p>The debate highlights the importance of ensuring the Speaker remains impartial and is not perceived as being beholden to any particular party or interest group.</p>
