      <p>Today, the parliament talked about the importance of addressing basic needs for all Canadians. The Liberal government has proposed an additional $200 per month to cover basic necessities, but critics argue that this amount is insufficient and that a universal basic income (UBI) would be more effective.</p>
<p>In fact, a UBI pilot project in Hamilton has shown promising results, with participants receiving a modest $17,000 per year. This increase led to improved dignity, education opportunities, and reduced stress among the recipients.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a separate discussion, the Conservative Party was criticized for introducing frivolous motions and then blaming the government for not stopping them from filibustering quickly enough. Damien Kurek, a Conservative member, responded by saying that the government controls the legislative agenda and that his party&rsquo;s actions are legitimate because they bring up important issues to debate.</p>
<p>The opposition parties have called for greater action to be taken against foreign interference in Canadian politics, despite being informed about threats to members of Parliament. The government has been criticized for downplaying the severity of these attacks and failing to take responsibility for keeping Canadians safe and upholding democracy.</p>
<p>In a related discussion, a recent cyberattack on several Canadian parliamentarians, including the speaker, was highlighted as a serious threat to Canadian security and democracy. The attack was attributed to APT31, a group affiliated with the Chinese government, which targeted the parliamentarians because of their parliamentary work.</p>
<p>The speaker emphasized the importance of taking these threats seriously to protect Canadians&rsquo; personal information and democratic institutions. They highlighted examples of hostile foreign states influencing Canadian elections and the lack of serious response from the government.</p>
<p>In conclusion, today&rsquo;s parliament debate has shown that there is a need for greater action to be taken against foreign interference in Canadian politics and for the protection of Canadians&rsquo; personal information and democracy.</p>
